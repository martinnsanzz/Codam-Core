## AI Usage

**AI was NOT used to generate code.** All function implementations were written by Martin™.

**Where AI was used:**

This README.md file was done by **human fingers, sweat and tears**. No AI wrote a single
line of text :)

# Project Notes (TEMP)

## Program arguments !!

Your program must take the following arguments (all mandatory):

```bash
./codexion number_of_coders time_to_burnout time_to_compile time_to_debug time_to_refactor number_of_compiles_required dongle_cooldown scheduler
```
- **number_of_coders**: The number of coders and also the number of dongles.
- **time_to_burnout (in milliseconds)**: If a coder did not start compiling within
time_to_burnout milliseconds since the beginning of their last compile or the
beginning of the simulation, they burn out.
- **time_to_compile (in milliseconds)**: The time it takes for a coder to compile.
During that time, they must hold two dongles.
- **time_to_debug (in milliseconds)**: The time a coder will spend debugging.
- **time_to_refactor (in milliseconds)**: The time a coder will spend refactoring.
After completing the refactoring phase, the coder will immediately attempt to
acquire dongles and start compiling again.
- **number_of_compiles_required**: If all coders have compiled at least this
many times, the simulation stops. Otherwise, it stops when a coder burns
out.
- **dongle_cooldown (in milliseconds)**: After being released, a dongle is unavailable until its cooldown has passed.
- **scheduler**: The arbitration policy used by dongles to decide who gets them
when multiple coders request them.



**Note:**The value must be exactly one of: `fifo` or `edf`.
- fifo means First In, First Out: the dongle is granted to the coder whose
request arrived first.
- edf means Earliest Deadline First with deadline = last_compile_start +
time_to_burnout.
