# DESCRIPTION
This project is part of milestone 1 of the core curriculum at codam. The objective of `ft_printf` is to re-implement `printf()` function from the standard C library by building a static library (`libftprintf.a`).
This function handles a variadic format string and outputs to stdout formatted text, returning the total number of characters written.

**Supported format specifiers:**

| Specifier | Output |
|---|---|
| `%c` | Single character |
| `%s` | String (`"(null)"` if NULL) |
| `%p` | Pointer address in hex (`"(nil)"` if NULL) |
| `%d` / `%i` | Signed decimal integer |
| `%u` | Unsigned decimal integer |
| `%x` / `%X` | Unsigned hex, lowercase / uppercase |
| `%%` | Literal `%` |

**Return value:**
- Total characters written on success.
- `-1` if `format` is NULL.
- Partial count if an invalid specifier is encountered (loop breaks early).

# INSTRUCTIONS
In order to use this library in your're project you will need to gitclone the repository into you're directory.

**Compilation:**
```bash
make
```
This will compile `libft` from the `libft/` subdirectory first, then it will build `libftprintf.a` at the root of the repository using `cc -Wall -Werror -Wextra` and `ar`

To utilize the library in you're project you will need to link them together using the following comand.

**Linking against your project:**
```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c -L. -lftprintf -o my_program
```
**Makefile rules:**

| Rule | Effect |
|---|---|
| `make` / `make all` | Builds `libftprintf.a` |
| `make clean` | Removes object files |
| `make fclean` | Removes object files and `libftprintf.a` |
| `make re` | `fclean` + `all` |

Clean and fclean rules also runs the same rules from the Makefile of libft so everything will be deleted accordingly from both libraries.

# RESOURCES

For the creation of this project the following resources were used:
- [GeeksforGeeks - Variadic Functions in c](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c/variadic-functions-in-c/)
- [cppreference - Variadic Functions](https://cppreference.com/w/c/variadic.html)
- [GeeksforGeeks - 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/32-bit-vs-64-bit-operating-systems/)

**AI usage:**

Claude by Anthropic was used in this project for the following:
- **As a teacher:** Explaining variadic function mechanics, `va_list` internals, and low-level C behavior.
- **Rewriting comments:** Improving clarity and precision of function-level documentation.
- **Testing:** Discussing edge cases and verifying expected behavior against the standard `printf()`.

AI was NOT used to write or generate any code. All function bodies were written by myself.

# ALGORITHM & DATA STRUCTURE

## Core loop
`ft_printf` loops across the format string one character at a time. Normal character are directly printed to stdout via `ft_printf_char`. When a `%` is found, the next character is validated by `check_format` against the included format specifiers.
	- If invalid, an error is written to stdeer and the loop breaks immediatly, returning a partial count.
	- If valid, `ft_handle_spec` calls the appropriate handler and the format pointer is moved past the specifier.
This method was chosen for clarity and extensibility. Each specifier goes to exactly one handler and adding a new one just requires a new handler and a new branch in `ft_handle_spec` and `check_format`.

## Length tracking via pointer
Neither of the handlers return a value
